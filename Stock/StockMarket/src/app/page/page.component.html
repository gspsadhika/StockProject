            <h5 class="text-center text-bold text-uppercase">STOCK MARKET</h5>
            <p>The stock market works through a network of exchanges â€” you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.</p>
